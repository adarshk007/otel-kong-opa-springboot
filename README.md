# Distributed Tracing Demo: Spring Boot (Java 17) + Kong + OPA + OpenTelemetry + Jaeger

This stack shows endâ€‘toâ€‘end distributed tracing through:
- Kong Gateway (OpenTelemetry plugin)
- Spring Boot service (Java 17) with OpenTelemetry Java agent
- OPA (authorization as a service) invoked by the app
- OpenTelemetry Collector (OTLP)
- Jaeger UI for exploring traces

## Quick start

```bash
# 1) Build the app image
docker compose build app

# 2) Start the stack
docker compose up -d

# 3) Hit the API through Kong (goes Kong -> app -> OPA)
curl -i http://localhost:8000/api/hello -H 'X-User: alice'

# Optional unauthorized example (OPA denies)
curl -i http://localhost:8000/api/secure

# 4) Open Jaeger UI
open http://localhost:16686  # (or just visit in your browser)
# Service names to look for: 'kong', 'spring-app'
```

### What you'll see
- Kong generates gateway spans via its OpenTelemetry plugin and **propagates W3C trace context** downstream.
- The Spring Boot app is autoâ€‘instrumented by the OpenTelemetry Java agent and **calls OPA**; that client HTTP call is traced too.
- The OpenTelemetry Collector receives spans from Kong and the app, then exports to Jaeger.

## Layout

```
otel-kong-opa-springboot/
â”œâ”€ docker-compose.yml
â”œâ”€ kong/
â”‚  â””â”€ kong.yml                  # DB-less declarative config (service, route, OpenTelemetry plugin)
â”œâ”€ otel-collector/
â”‚  â””â”€ config.yaml               # Receives OTLP, exports to Jaeger
â”œâ”€ opa/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ policy.rego               # Simple authz policy
â”‚  â””â”€ data.json                 # Example data (roles/users)
â””â”€ app/
   â”œâ”€ Dockerfile
   â”œâ”€ pom.xml
   â””â”€ src/main/java/com/example/demo/
      â”œâ”€ DemoApplication.java
      â”œâ”€ web/HelloController.java
      â””â”€ opa/OpaClient.java
```

## Notes

- Kong config uses the **OpenTelemetry plugin** with `header_type = w3c` so it will forward `traceparent` to the upstream app.  
- The Spring app uses the **OpenTelemetry Java Agent** (downloaded in the Dockerfile). No code changes are required for basic tracing.
- The app explicitly calls OPA for authorization **inside the request flow**, so that call shows up as a child span.
- Everything exports traces via OTLP to the **OpenTelemetry Collector**, which forwards to **Jaeger**.

## Tear down
```bash
docker compose down -v
```


```bash
cd otel-kong-opa-springboot
docker compose build app
docker compose up -d

# through Kong (Kong -> app -> OPA). Allowed:
curl -i http://localhost:8000/api/hello -H 'X-User: alice'

# denied example (no X-User on /secure):
curl -i http://localhost:8000/api/secure

# open Jaeger UI to see traces
# http://localhost:16686

```

## ðŸ”Ž End-to-end Trace Flow

**When you send a request through Kong, hereâ€™s what happens:**

- Kong Gateway receives the request
- OpenTelemetry plugin creates a root span like kong /api/hello.
- Trace context (traceparent, tracestate) headers are injected.
- Spring Boot App receives the request
- OTel Java agent creates a server span GET /api/hello.
- The trace context is continued from Kong.
- Spring Boot calls OPA for authorization
- A child span HTTP POST /v1/data/http/authz/allow appears.
- This shows the request to OPA and its latency.
- OPA evaluates the policy(OPA itself isnâ€™t instrumented, so you donâ€™t see spans inside OPA, but the HTTP call span is there).
- Response bubbles back, trace completes.

## OUTPUT
```
Trace ID: 9f3d1a2c7b4e8f12...

kong /api/hello             [span]
â””â”€â”€ spring-app GET /api/hello   [span]
    â””â”€â”€ HTTP POST OPA /v1/data/http/authz/allow   [span]
```
